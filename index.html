<h1> Vaccines Train Our Bodies to Fight Germs</h1>
<br>
<p>Vaccines help us fight disease by training our bodies to attack germs. Vaccines have a version of the germ which look just like the real thing, but are actually harmless. The figure below shows how they work. The “fake” germs are recognized by antibodies, molecules which tag potential germs for destruction. Our bodies learn how to make antibodies which recognize that germ. When the real germ comes, our bodies are prepared to make antibodies for it. Vaccines help us fend off countless germs which would otherwise be lethal, such as measles. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is much misinformation on the internet about the risks of vaccines. Some even claim that vaccines can cause autism. Much of these rumors stem from a single paper published in 1998, claiming a link between the vaccine for MMR and autism. That paper has been universally condemned by scientists as fraudulent. The author manipulated his evidence to mislead readers, and he has since lost his medical license. The potential dangers of vaccines have been exhaustively investigated by researchers, and the overwhelming consensus is that vaccines are safe.< p>
